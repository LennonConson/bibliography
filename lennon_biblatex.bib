  abstract     = {We consider a stochastic single item production-inventory-routing problem with a single producer, multiple clients, and multiple vehicles. At the clients, demand is allowed to be backlogged incurring a penalty cost. Demands are considered uncertain. A recourse model is presented, and valid inequalities are introduced to enhance the model. A new general approach that explores the sample average approximation (SAA) method is introduced. In the sample average approximation method, several sample sets are generated and solved independently in order to obtain a set of candidate solutions. Then, the candidate solutions are tested on a larger sample, and the best solution is selected among the candidates. In contrast to this approach, called static, we propose an adjustable approach that explores the candidate solutions in order to identify common structures. Using that information, part of the first-stage decision variables is fixed, and the resulting restricted problem is solved for a larger size sample. Several heuristic algorithms based on the mathematical model are considered within each approach. Computational tests based on randomly generated instances are conducted to test several variants of the two approaches. The results show that the new adjustable SAA heuristic performs better than the static one for most of the instances.},

The total cost is given by the sum of the total fixed cost plus the expected minimum total flow cost, when the throughput costs of the facilities are random variables with unknown probability distribution. By applying the asymptotic approximation method derived from the Extreme Value Theory, a deterministic non-linear model, which belongs to a wide class of Entropy maximizing models, is then obtained. In this paper, we present a deep analysis of the impact of different probability distributions of the random costs on the problem optimum, as well as on the number of facilities located. The computational results show a very good performance of the deterministic model when compared to the stochastic one.},

  abstract   = {Robust optimization is still a relatively new approach to optimization problems affected by uncertainty, but it has already proved so useful in real applications that it is difficult to tackle such problems today without considering this powerful methodology. Written by the principal developers of robust optimization, and describing the main achievements of a decade of research, this is the first book to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the subject. Robust optimization is designed to meet some major challenges associated with uncertainty-affected optimization problems: to operate under lack of full information on the nature of uncertainty; to model the problem in a form that can be solved efficiently; and to provide guarantees about the performance of the solution. The book starts with a relatively simple treatment of uncertain linear programming, proceeding with a deep analysis of the interconnections between the construction of appropriate uncertainty sets and the classical chance constraints (probabilistic) approach. It then develops the robust optimization theory for uncertain conic quadratic and semidefinite optimization problems and dynamic (multistage) problems. The theory is supported by numerous examples and computational illustrations. An essential book for anyone working on optimization and decision making under uncertainty, Robust Optimization also makes an ideal graduate textbook on the subject.},

In contrast to the Monge-Kantorovitch problem, recent approaches model the branched structure of such supply networks as minima of an energy functional whose essential feature is to favour wide roads. Such a branched structure is observable in ground transportation networks, in draining and irrigation systems, in electrical power supply systems and in natural counterparts such as blood vessels or the branches of trees. These lectures provide mathematical proof of several existence, structure and regularity properties empirically observed in transportation networks. The link with previous discrete physical models of irrigation and erosion models in geomorphology and with discrete telecommunication and transportation models is discussed. It will be mathematically proven that the majority fit in the simple model sketched in this volume.},

This field is currently developing rapidly with contributions from many disciplines including operations research, mathematics, and probability. At the same time, it is now being applied in a wide variety of subjects ranging from agriculture to financial planning and from industrial engineering to computer networks. This textbook provides a first course in stochastic programming suitable for students with a basic knowledge of linear programming, elementary analysis, and probability. The authors aim to present a broad overview of the main themes and methods of the subject. Its prime goal is to help students develop an intuition on how to model uncertainty into mathematical problems, what uncertainty changes bring to the decision process, and what techniques help to manage uncertainty in solving the problems.In this extensively updated new edition there is more material on methods and examples including several new approaches for discrete variables, new results on risk measures in modeling and Monte Carlo sampling methods, a new chapter on relationships to other methods including approximate dynamic programming, robust optimization and online methods.The book is highly illustrated with chapter summaries and many examples and exercises. Students, researchers and practitioners in operations research and the optimization area will find it particularly of interest.

Using many examples to illustrate the different techniques useful for formulating models, this text beautifully elucidates the breadth of modeling capabilities that are supported by Pyomo and its handling of complex real-world applications. In the third edition, much of the material has been reorganized, new examples have been added, and a new chapter has been added describing how modelers can improve the performance of their models. The authors have also modified their recommended method for importing Pyomo. A big change in this edition is the emphasis of concrete models, which provide fewer restrictions on the specification and use of Pyomo models.  Pyomo is an open source software package for formulating and solving large-scale optimization problems. The software extends the modeling approach supported by modern AML (Algebraic Modeling Language) tools. Pyomo is a flexible, extensible, and portable AML that is embedded in Python, a full-featured scripting language. Python is a powerful and dynamic programming language that has a very clear, readable syntax and intuitive object orientation. Pyomo includes Python classes for defining sparse sets, parameters, and variables, which can be used to formulate algebraic expressions that define objectives and constraints. Moreover, Pyomo can be used from a command-line interface and within Python's interactive command environment, which makes it easy to create Pyomo models, apply a variety of optimizers, and examine solutions.},

  abstract     = {Despite engineers’ best intentions, technological innovations intended to reduce resource consumption are not assured to achieve their desired effects. As self-interested agents utilize the technological innovation, theretofore unprofitable activities may be rendered profitable, leading to a disparity between the expected reduction in resource consumption and what is actually achieved. This rebound effect is particularly salient given the current global climate crisis. In practice, many national governments are promoting fuel efficiency gains via new, cutting-edge technologies. However, to maximize the effectiveness of such technological innovations, additional regulation is likely required to avoid unfavorable rebound effects. To further study the dynamics of this setting, we set forth a logistics-based Stackelberg game underpinned by the Traveling Purchaser Problem. More specifically, we develop a bilevel programming formulation wherein the upper-level player is a regulator and the lower-level player is the purchaser. The regulator encounters a multi-objective problem and desires to reduce resource consumption while minimally disrupting commerce on the network. Mathematical conditions are derived and proved to determine when the null regulator action is optimal. These results are leveraged to develop a preprocessing algorithm and customized heuristic solution methodology. Extensive empirical testing is conducted on these methods and their results are analyzed using statistical techniques to quantitatively characterize their behavior. Analysis confirms the supposition that regulation and technological innovations are often required in tandem to achieve a regulator’s aims; however, it also reveals that, under select conditions, the regulator is better served by not intervening.},

Aristotle Transportation systems consist not only of the physical and organizational e- ments that interact with each other to produce transportation opportunities, but also of the demand that takes advantage of such opportunities to travel from one place to another.

  abstract   = {An accessible treatment of the modeling and solution of integer programming problems, featuring modern applications and software In order to fully comprehend the algorithms associated with integer programming, it is important to understand not only how algorithms work, but also why they work. Applied Integer Programming features a unique emphasis on this point, focusing on problem modeling and solution using commercial software. Taking an application-oriented approach, this book addresses the art and science of mathematical modeling related to the mixed integer programming (MIP) framework and discusses the algorithms and associated practices that enable those models to be solved most efficiently. The book begins with coverage of successful applications, systematic modeling procedures, typical model types, transformation of non-MIP models, combinatorial optimization problem models, and automatic preprocessing to obtain a better formulation. Subsequent chapters present algebraic and geometric basic concepts of linear programming theory and network flows needed for understanding integer programming. Finally, the book concludes with classical and modern solution approaches as well as the key components for building an integrated software system capable of solving large-scale integer programming and combinatorial optimization problems. Throughout the book, the authors demonstrate essential concepts through numerous examples and figures. Each new concept or algorithm is accompanied by a numerical example, and, where applicable, graphics are used to draw together diverse problems or approaches into a unified whole. In addition, features of solution approaches found in today's commercial software are identified throughout the book. Thoroughly classroom-tested, Applied Integer Programming is an excellent book for integer programming courses at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as a well-organized reference for professionals, software developers, and analysts who work in the fields of applied mathematics, computer science, operations research, management science, and engineering and use integer-programming techniques to model and solve real-world optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper an integer linear program is formulated to identify the least cost two-level hierarchical network. This network must include a primary path from a predetermined starting node to a predetermined terminus node. In addition, each node not on the primary path must be connected to some node on that path via a secondary path. Transshipment facilities are required at the intersections of the primary and secondary paths. Consequently, the formulation directly considers the number and locations of transshipment facilities in determining the minimal cost network. A heuristic is presented which employs a K Shortest Path algorithm and a Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm. Heuristic results of two sample problems are presented and compared to the results obtained by solving the integer LP formulation.},

Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the maximum independent set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find that the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and we experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm’s performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins.},

In our chance-constrained approach to the problem, restrictions are placed on the probability that individual time window constraints are violated, while the objective remains based on traditional routing costs. In this paper, we propose a way to offer this probability, or service level, for all customers. Our approach carefully considers how to compute the start-service time and arrival time distributions for each customer. These distributions are used to create a feasibility check that can be “plugged” into any algorithm for the VRPTW and thus be used to solve large problems fairly quickly. Our computational experiments show how the solutions change for some well-known data sets across different levels of customer service, two travel time distributions, and several parameter settings.},

  abstract   = {This book presents state-of-the-art research and practice in optimization routing, specifically the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Since its introduction in the late 1950s, the VRP has been a very significant area of research and practice in operations research. Vehicles are used to make deliveries and for pick-ups every day and everywhere. Companies such as Amazon, UPS, FedEx, and DHL use route optimization to reduce mileage, fuel use, number of trucks on the road, and carbon dioxide emissions. The authors compile and analyze 135 survey and review articles on vehicle routing topics published between 2005 and 2022 in an effort to make key observations about publication and trend history, summarize the overall contributions in the field, and identify trends in VRP research and practice. The authors have compiled published research on models, algorithms, and applications for specific areas, including: alternative and multiple objectives; arc routing and general routing; drones, last-mile delivery, and urban distribution; dynamic and stochastic routing; green routing; inventory routing; loading constraints; location-routing; multiple depots; pickup and delivery and dial-a-ride problems; rich and multi-attribute routing; routing over time; shipping; two-echelon, collaborative, and inter-terminal problems; specific variants, benchmark datasets, and software; and exact algorithms and heuristics. In addition, the book discusses how vehicle routing problems are among the most widely studied problems in combinatorial optimization due to the mathematical complexity and practical significance.},

The authorsproclaimed:“Nopractical applications of the method have been made as yet. ” In the nearly 50 years since the Dantzig and Ramser paper appeared, work in the ?eld has exploded dramatically. Today, a Google Scholar search of the words vehicle routing problem (VRP) yields more than 21,700 entries. The June 2006 issue of OR/MS Today provided a survey of 17 vendors of commercial routing software whose packages are currently capable of solving average-size problems with 1,000 stops, 50 routes, and two-hour hard-time windows in two to ten minutes [2]. In practice, vehicle routing may be the single biggest success story in operations research. For example, each day 103,500 drivers at UPS follow computer-generated routes. The drivers visit 7. 9 million customers and handle an average of 15. 6 million packages [3].},

  abstract     = {A relevant, applied problem in the location analysis literature is the effective location and allocation of resources to detect and interdict intruders traversing a defended region. For selected applications, defender resources are designed to detect and/or interdict intruders on specific parts (or stages) of the respective paths. Within this context, this research is motivated by the problem of effectively defending a set of population centers against attack by a limited number of intercontinental ballistic missiles (i.e., intruders). Herein, the defensive actions entail the location of ballistic missile defense resources to detect and interdict missiles over a range of possible launch-to-target missile paths and their respective, spatio-temporally defined stages of flight. Assumed is an adversary capability to observe the defensive asset locations and respond with an intercontinental ballistic missile targeting strategy that maximizes the expected damage of an attack. The research presents a bilevel programming model for the corresponding Stackelberg game and, via transformations and reformulations, identifies a single-objective mixed-integer nonlinear program that can be addressed with any of several commercially available solvers. Upon proving the convexity of the resulting formulation to assure reported solutions are globally optimal, comparative testing identifies the commercial solver ANTIGONE as preferred for solving instances of the underlying problem. Empirical testing via a designed experiment examines which scenario features of the underlying problem are most significant for predicting the required computational effort to solve problem instances, yielding insight into the practical nature of this research to address instances of increasing size.},

While they offer new possibilities for solving optimization problems, their true potential is still an open question. As the optimal design of adiabatic algorithms plays an important role in their assessment, we illustrate the aspects and challenges to consider when implementing optimization problems on quantum annealing hardware based on the example of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). We demonstrate that tunneling between local minima can be exponentially suppressed if the quantum dynamics are not carefully tailored to the problem. Furthermore we show that inequality constraints, in particular, present a major hurdle for the implementation on analog quantum annealers. We finally argue that programmable digital quantum annealers can overcome many of these obstacles and can - once large enough quantum computers exist - provide an interesting route to using quantum annealing on a large class of problems.},

Within the context of the static weapon target assignment problem, this research develops and empirically compares alternative methods to rationalize an adversary’s value hierarchy over targets that informs their observed decisions. Such methods either identify the extreme points of a polytope within a unit simplex of relative target values that encompasses all possible relative target values based on a weak dominance criterion or a subset of points within the polytope. This research characterizes the solution methods’ practical tractability for use on larger-sized problems and their generalizability to other problems. Even for the superlative technique examined, testing illustrates the computationally challenging nature of identifying the defining polytope of relative target values, and the work concludes with suggestions for metaheuristic technique development.},

We contrast SAA with stochastic approximation (SA) methods in terms of the computational effort required to obtain solutions of a given quality, explaining why SA “wins” asymptotically. However, an extension of SAA known as retrospective optimization can match the asymptotic convergence rate of SA, at least up to a multiplicative constant.},

  abstract     = {Purpose This paper recommends new criteria for selecting seaports of embarkation during military deployments. Most importantly, this research compares the current port selection criterion, which is to select the seaport with the shortest inland transport time from the deploying installation, to the proposed port selection criteria, which are to select the seaport based on the shortest combined inland and oceanic transit time to the destination theater. Design/methodology/approach The authors construct an original integer program to select seaports that minimize the expected delivery timeline for a set of notional, but realistic, deployment requirements. The integer program is solved considering the current as well as the proposed port selection criteria. The solutions are then compared using paired-samples t-tests to assess the statistical significance of the port selection criteria. Findings This work suggests that the current port selection criterion results in a 10–13\% slower delivery of deploying forces as compared to the proposed port selection criteria. Research limitations/implications This work assumes deterministic inland transit times, oceanic transit times, and seaport processing rates. Operational fluctuations in transit times and processing rates are not expected to change the findings from this research. Practical implications This research provides evidence that the current port selection criterion for selecting seaports for military units deploying from the Continental United States is suboptimal. More importantly, logistics planners could use these recommended port selection criteria to reduce the expected delivery timelines during military deployments. Originality/value Several military doctrinal references suggest that planners select seaports based on habitual installation-to-port pairings, especially for early deployers. This work recommends a change to the military's current port selection process based on empirical analyses that show improvements to deployment timelines.},

  abstract   = {Transportation systems analysis is a multidisciplinary field which draws on engineering, economics, operations research, political science, psychology, management, and other disciplines. The major text synthesizes from these fields an approach that is intellectually coherent and comprehensive. Numerous details are provided to indicate how major concepts can be applied in practice to particular modes and problems. But the major objective of this book is to provide the reader with a basic framework onto which many different areas of specialization can be added by later coursework and practical experience. Fundamentals of Transportation Systems Analysis identifies concepts that are truly fundamental to serious work in the planning, design, or management of transportation systems. It also emphasizes, through more detailed treatment, certain topics, such as transportation demand and performance and the processes of evaluation and choice, that are inadequately treated in the available literature. A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on multimodal solutions to transportation problems. The student is taught to view the transportation system as a unified whole and to evaluate it within the context of the overall social, economic, and political system of a given region. According to Professor Manheim, "The challenge of transportation systems analysis is to intervene, delicately and deliberately, in the complex fabric of a society to use transport effectively, in coordination with other public and private actions, to achieve the goals of that society."},

To develop the solution method, an accelerated sample average approximation approach is combined with an accelerated Benders’ decomposition algorithm. The accelerated sample average approximation approach improves the main structure of the original technique through the reduction in the number of mixed integer programming problems that need to be solved. Furthermore, the recently accelerated Benders’ decomposition approach is utilized to expedite the solution time of the mixed integer programming problems. In order to examine the performance of the proposed solution method, the computational experiments are performed on developed stochastic supply chain network design problems. The computational results show that the accelerated solution method solves these problems efficiently. The synergy of the two accelerated approaches improves the computational procedure by an average factor of over 42\%, and over 12\% in comparison with the original and the recently modified methods, respectively. Moreover, the betterment of the computational process increases substantially with the size of the problem.},

We consider a problem that occurs in the aftermath of a natural disaster: a transportation system for supplying disaster victims with relief goods must be established. We propose bi-objective optimization models with a monetary objective and humanitarian objective. Uncertainty in the accessibility of the road network is modeled by a discrete set of scenarios. The key features of our model are the determination of locations for intermediate depots and acquisition of vehicles. Several model variants are considered. First, the operating budget can be fixed at the first stage for all possible scenarios or determined for each scenario at the second stage. Second, the assignment of vehicles to a depot can be either fixed or free. Third, we compare a heterogeneous vehicle fleet to a homogeneous fleet. We study the impact of the variants on the solutions. The set of Pareto-optimal solutions is computed by applying the adaptive Epsilon-constraint method. We solve the deterministic equivalents of the two-stage stochastic programs using the MIP-solver CPLEX.},

Studying optimization problems motivates to develop advanced techniques more suited to contemporary practical problems. Among those, especially the NP hard problems provide an apt platform to demonstrate supremacy of quantum over classical technologies in terms of resources and time. TSP is one such NP hard problem in combinatorial optimization which takes exponential time order for solving by brute force method. Here we propose a quantum algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem using phase estimation technique. We approach the problem by encoding the given distances between the cities as phases. We construct unitary operators whose eigenvectors are the computational basis states and eigenvalues are various combinations of these phases. Then we apply phase estimation algorithm to certain eigenstates which give us all the total distances possible for all the routes. After obtaining the distances we can search through this information using the quantum search algorithm for finding the minimum to find the least possible distance as well the route taken. This provides us a quadratic speedup over the classical brute force method for a large number of cities. In this paper, we illustrate an example of the travelling salesman problem by taking four cities and present the results by simulating the codes in the IBM's quantum simulator.},

In this technique the expected objective function of the stochastic problem is approximated by a sample average estimate derived from a random sample. The resulting sample average approximating problem is then solved by deterministic optimization techniques. The process is repeated with different samples to obtain candidate solutions along with statistical estimates of their optimality gaps.},

Recently, the applications of Grover's algorithm to solve global optimization problems have been demonstrated, where unknown optimum solutions are found by iteratively improving the threshold value for the selective phase shift operator in Grover rotation. In this paper, a hybrid approach that combines continuous-time quantum walks with Grover search is proposed so that the search is accelerated with improved threshold values. By taking advantage of the quantum tunneling effect, better threshold values can be found at the early stage of the search process so that the sharpness of probability improves. The results between the new algorithm, existing Grover search, and classical heuristic algorithms are compared.},

The problem has strong implications in the context of freight logistics and transit system design. This paper first focuses on a Euclidean plane and shows that a tight upper bound can be achieved by a type of elongated cyclic hexagons, while a cost lower bound based on relaxation and idealization is also obtained. The gap between the analytical upper and lower bounds is within 0.3\%. This paper then shows that a similar elongated non-cyclic hexagon shape, with proper orientation, is actually optimal for service regions on a rectilinear metric plane. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the analytical findings and to draw further insights.},
